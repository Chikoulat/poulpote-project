The poulpote-project: 
This is my first project at the Wild code school.
the project was to create a streaming platform for kids with a selection of movies, the user will interact with the mascot poulpoute who will ask him some questions, and come up with a list of movies depending on the user's answers.
the website uses moslty Javascript, along with HTML and CSS.
